Adds Stargate-like portals to the game.
These are built by first building a ring of portalstruct and then setting the core in the following formation

S = portalstruct
A = air
C = core

SSSSS
SAAAS
SAAAS
SAAAS
SSCSS

Now you'll have to set a the controller next to the portal (max. 3 blocks away)

Your portal is now built (YAY :D). To use it, follow the these steps:

1) Each portal has an unique adress, so find it out. You can find the adress of a portal by rightclicking the controller of that portal. The adress is the string in the coloured bar.
2) Now fuel up your portal. To do so, rightclick the core and place some blue/red/green mese (see how to craft that in the crafts section) into the slot.
3) Call the destination gate: Rightclick the controller and write the adress of your destination into the destination tab. Now click the teleport-button
   (The Portal should be open now. YAY :D)
4) Walk through the portal
5) Close the portal on the other sind by rightclicking the controller and pressing the teleport-button once
